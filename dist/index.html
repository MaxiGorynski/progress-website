            <div class="block-title">About Progress</div>
            <div class="subtitle">Not too long ago…</div>
            <div class="text-block">
                …a group of people – software engineers, AI scientists, founders of successful companies, megaproject managers, university professors, healthcare specialists – came together <span class="highlight-text" id="highlight1">united by three common and uncontroversial beliefs</span>.
                <br><br>
                That Britain, one of the finest and most successful states ever to rise from the earth, was and is in terminal decline.
                <br><br>
                That this decline can be stopped, for Britain to move on to a level of success and stability beyond even what it has known historically.
                <br><br>
                <span class="highlight-text" id="highlight2">And that this decline must be stopped.</span>
                <br><br>
                Guided by these common beliefs, and being utterly unwilling to leave their fulfilment to chance, we put our hands together and formed the Progress party.
                <br><br>
                Progress is a party formed of and propelled by able, normal people with great records in building things and an intense contempt for generations of Westminster misgovernment. To the political elite, this makes us dangerous outsiders. If this is so, then we are honoured to bear the accusation.
                <br><br>
                <span class="highlight-text" id="highlight3">Our platform is simple, oriented around our vision of A Kingdom United.</span>
                <br><br>
                Economically, we believe in a Britain whose growth is propelled by cutting edge technology and high creativity. We believe in monumental reindustrialisation. We believe in a focus on skills and training for all, to create tracks to prosperity for everyone.
                <br><br>
                Socially, we believe that it should be the right of all people to walk down the street at night without fear of harm. We believe in a stance on white collar crime that is as firm as our stance on violent and petty crime. We believe in a multiracial monoculture, a nation defined not by cursory differences as abide between us, but by shared celebration of the classically British values that made this country the freest, fairest, and most successful in the world.
                <br><br>
                <span class="highlight-text" id="highlight4">And we believe above all in a state that serves its citizens.</span> In courts that serve the interests of the law-abiding, not the criminal. In a civil service that is lean, cost-effective and hyper-productive. In a crown jewel health service that provides for its people whenever they need it. In a political class that isn't bothered about the political left or the political right, but is defined only by its will, its skill, and its willingness to serve.
                <br><br>
                We are a party devoted to bringing about the glory of our name: <span class="highlight-text" id="highlight5">Progress, for one and all.</span> A party that believes in the heroism, rationality, and beauty of human beings. In the greatness of Britain, and of the British people. In the magnificence of our Common Law, which forms the heart of every constitution held close to the chests of all of the freest, most successful countries in the world.
                <br><br>
                A party that believes in the credo of "Always Better Today Than Yesterday."
                <br><br>
                A party that believes in its own almost-impossible mission – to win its first election not five years after being formed. It is a fundamentally unreasonable aim, but these are unreasonable times. The service of the people of Britain cannot wait any longer. And just as we believe that the answers to the questions facing the British people are within them, so do we believe that it is within us.
                <br><br>
                That, like all good things however unlikely, <span class="highlight-text" id="highlight6">It Can Be Done.</span>

            <h3>Confidentiality Agreement</h3>
            <p>This confidentiality agreement (the "Agreement") is dated <span id="current-date"></span>.</p>
            <p>The Agreement is to hold between Bletchley Point Ltd., and any future entity to which the venture in question may in future be renamed (the "Company"), represented by Maxi Gorynski [General Director], and <input type="text" id="new-member-name" placeholder="Your name"> (the "New Member").</p>

            <h4>1. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information</h4>
            <p>By signing this confidentiality agreement, the New Member agrees to the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>They shall not copy, distribute, or otherwise disseminate any material belonging to the Company – inclusive of but not limited to documents, digital or material assets, logos, strategic plans, marketing materials, contact registers, software products, codebases, databases, communications logs, letters and correspondence, and financial information; they shall not do so orally, in writing, or by any other format</li>
                <li>They shall not use or exploit any Confidential Information given to them in any way except for the Purpose, the Purpose which shall be defined as any and all work for Bletchley Point and any and all of its subsidiaries, including the Progress party, which the New Member enters into individually or in collaboration with other Members;</li>
                <li>That while the New Member may accept contract or other forms of agreement to work on initiatives in a comparable space to the Company, they agree not to unduly disseminate sensitive knowledge or proprietary materials that are property of the Company to third parties without express, prior approval of the Company;</li>
                <li>They shall not disclose or make available the Confidential Information to any third party, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement;</li>
                <li>They shall not utilise the Confidential Information for any commercial reason, independently or in collaboration with any third party;</li>
                <li>They shall not copy, reduce to writing or otherwise record the Confidential Information except as strictly necessary for the Purpose (and any such copies, reductions to writing and records shall be the property of the Disclosing Party); and</li>
                <li>They shall apply the same security measures and degree of care to the Confidential Information as the Recipient applies to its own confidential information</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>2. Permitted Disclosure of Confidential Information</h4>
            <p>The New Member may not disclose Confidential Information outside the remit of the Company except with the express, prior permission of the Company. They may disclose the Company's Confidential Information to those of the New Member's Representatives who need to know this Confidential Information for the Purpose, provided that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>it informs its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, or the aspects of the Solution to be disclosed, before disclosure, and likewise obtains signed, written approval from the Disclosing Party for the Confidential Information to be disclosed;</li>
                <li>It procures that its Representatives shall, in relation to any Confidential Information disclosed to them (or information shared as regards the Solution), comply with this Agreement as if they were the Recipient and, if the Disclosing Party so requests, procure that any relevant Representative enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party on terms equivalent to those contained in this Agreement,</li>
                <li>The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information, or information about the Solution, to the extent such Confidential Information is required:
                    <ol>
                        <li>to be disclosed by law, rule or regulation; or</li>
                        <li>by any governmental, judicial or other regulatory authority (including, without limitation, any recognised stock exchange or by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction),</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The parties agree that this Agreement shall not restrict the discussion, disclosure, or use of information that pertains solely to matters of health and social care, including but not limited to topics falling under the remit of public health policy, service provision, or healthcare system operations.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>3. Reservation of Rights and Acknowledgement</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. The Disclosing Party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information. No rights, including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights, in respect of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information are granted to the Recipient and no obligations are imposed on the Disclosing Party other than those expressly stated in this Agreement.</li>
                <li>Intellectual Property as produced by the New Member for the Purpose shall be made IP of the Company, unless an agreement is brokered and achieved between the New Member and the Company to specify an alternative arrangement of ownership relative to specific IP.</li>
                <li>The disclosure of Confidential Information by the Disclosing Party shall not form any offer by, or representation or warranty on the part of, the Disclosing Party to enter into any further agreement in relation to the Purpose.</li>
                <li>The Recipient acknowledges that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies it may have, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek the granting of equitable relief (including without limitation injunctive relief) concerning any threatened or actual breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>If the Recipient has included a secondary name/handle at the head of this document (for example, a pseudonym/social media handle), then it shall also follow that the Company shall hold the Recipient's legal name as Confidential Information belonging to the Recipient and shall not reveal it, including, if it is the Recipient's wish, to any personnel outside of the Company's Heads of Function, unless compelled to do so by law.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The obligations of each Party shall, notwithstanding any earlier termination of negotiations or discussions between the parties in relation to the Purpose, continue for no fewer than five years from the date of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Any failure to exercise or any delay in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy or a waiver of any other right or remedy and no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy under this Agreement will prevent any further exercise of that right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy.</p>
            <p>No variation or agreed termination of this Agreement shall be of any force or effect unless in writing and signed by each Party.</p>
